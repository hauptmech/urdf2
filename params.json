{"name":"Urdf2","tagline":"Update the ROS URDF Format","body":"### Introduction\r\nThe URDF (Universal Robot Description Format) has not been updated in quite a while. Although it has served the ROS community admirably, it has several notable shortcomings. In this effort, we will try to modify the URDF specification to catch up with the needs of the ROS community\r\n\r\n### Shortcomings\r\n* Multiple robots - The URDF currently supports a single _robot_ tag. Putting multiple robots together into a URDF can only be done by combining them (manually or through the use of Xacro) into a single robot element. \r\n* Closed loop chains - The URDF is not as _Universal_ as the name implies, e.g. it does not support closed loop chains. \r\n* Groups - Software like MoveIt! uses groups of joints as a fundamental element. Groups are used to specify configuration for planning and could also be used for elements like ROS-Control.\r\n* Sensors - URDF has no support for sensors. \r\n* Actuators - URDF has no support for actuator specification (used in ROS-Control).\r\n* Zero State/Default State - The URDF defaults the initial state of a robot to zero joint values. This might be an issue for certain robots since the zero joint value might not be reachable. \r\n* Saved states - The URDF does not support the storing of named states for the robot(s), e.g. HOME or READY.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n#### SDF Format ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
